# wisort
Your sorting wizard

## Requirements
- python `>=3.14`
## Idea
Create a file sorter/formatter that works like "magic" i.e. that manages many decisions smartly for the user.

Sorting modes or "characters":
- different modes do different magic/behave differently

Future ideas:
too much just for siege but would be really cool: sorting mode that has a custom ai model that recognizes types of files: school, work, etc.
this would solve the problem that normal sorting clis have that sorting by filetype doesnt understand the context
