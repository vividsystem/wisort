    - [ ] Apprentice:
        - [x] decent storytelling
        - [ ] interactive confirmation based stuff -> confirm every move, delete, symlink, dedupe
        -> fitting the apprentices role as someone needing to be guided

    - [ ] Magician
        - [ ] doing all the stuff the apprentice does but with automatic resolving of issues
    - [ ] Witch
        - [ ]  doing all the stuff the magician does but changing your files in the process

    - [ ] Dragon
        -> levels your house in one breath i.e flattens folders

- "The magic" 
    - [ ] smart unzip
    - [ ] preserve file structure on move
    - [ ] replace by symlink
        - [ ] intentional duplicate recognition
    - [ ] diffing deduplication -> support for partial copies
